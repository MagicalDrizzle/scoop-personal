  - `reversion`
```
Usage: Revers32/64.exe <InputFile> <OSMajor> <OSMinor> <SubsysMajor> <SubsysMinor>
Despite the name, the OS fields doesn't seem to be regarded by the OS, but rather the Subsys ones.
Setting the OS fields to 10 0 (Win10) and Subsys fields to 5 1 (WinXP) will allow the binary to run on XP.
Conversely, OS 5 1 (WinXP) and Subsys 10 0 (Win10) will not.
Lunarcast recommends setting OSMajor and OSMinor to 1 and 0 respectively and more or less ignore them.
